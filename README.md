## Description

This project wasn't easy for me.  I definitely held onto it way longer than I should have, and it eventually evolved into my React portfolio.  It looks much better IMO in React, and I tweaked the colors a lot.  I tried to keep this as in "original condition as possible" due to not wanting to just submit the React portfolio, but I did do a few changes, and just scrapped the old README.md.  

## Challenges

My challenges were numerous, but mainly, I didn't know how to think like a coder just yet.  I didn't understand the "steps."  I understood the concepts decently enough, but as far as habits, methods of study, general coding practices such as formatting, resources, and shortcuts - those were severely lacking. I had a basic skeleton of what I wanted to put in my
portfolio, but going back and just hooking everything up and filling in the gaps was significantly easier now that I have more practice in the field (Needless to say).  

I also struggled with imposter syndrome, which deterred me from submitting anything on time because I was just too embarrassed. I have been a perfectionist all my life, and anything less than perfect used to be unacceptable. Coding has taught me that this mindset is unhealthy, and unneccesary.  Do the best you can, submit, and see what you can do better, and then do better.  If you can't do better today, try again tomorrow, and if you can't do better tomorrow, that's okay, try again the next day.  

If there is anything I've learned from this course, it's accepting that nothing is ever going to be perfect, so do your best and submit anyway and learn from every experience.
